# CS2450 Journal

Date: 08.31.25  
Subject: First Journal Entry  
Today I created my `journal.md` file in VS Code and pushed it to GitHub.  
I learned how to check if a folder is a Git repo using `ls -a` and `git status`.

Subject: Idea storming

Today we looked at the you face assignment and worked on brainstorming ideas for our website, we had some great ideas. 

For flask, it grabs infor from the server to your computer, it aslo allows us to write python. It's pretty easy to use so hopefully it doenst give us too much trouble. 

On the buisness end, we learned the chain of command:

-Investors set the timeline and expectations.
-Stakholders are responsible for communicating with you and telling you what they want.
-Product managment follows the timeline and meets the requirments.
-Architects figure out the tech stack, figure out how things interact and how teams work alongside eachother. 
-Engineers are your co workers. Be a great team player.
-Quality assurance people just look over your product and try to refine it. 
-Dev Ops are other engineers that solve all the problems from the engineers. They also worry about security and stability.
- User experience gives advice and guidlines for the layout of the product, which colors to use, which margins and sizes need to be adjusted.

Subject: Customer satisfaction/interaction

We learned the process of taking instruction and bringing it to life. The key is to talk first and build around the customers needs, most often programmers build the product and try to sell it to the customer and the customer has no idea what their being sold because they dont know anything about programming. 

Along with communication with the customer, you as a employee/buisness needs to be thinking about the little things that matter, like scope, cost, time commitment, possible problems, etc....

If we were to get quized we would say:

Someone who understands & can communicate the requirments.
Smart people who can build stuff.

Subject: Software Requirments

We are getting the requirments fro our website, these are the essential aspects:

- Log in
- Main banner
- Main menu
- Make a post
- Friends
- Feed
- AI integration
- Log in mini games

Subject: Architecture

Basically how we build our products, which choices to make and what resources we have at our disposal.

Forces at work:

-complex and rapidly changing tools.
-Time pressure.
-Cost, company requirments, affinity for the familiar, incumbent tech.

Keep in mind:

-less than 10% of failed products state wrong "tech" as the problem. So 90% is on communication.

- Speed vs storage

-Time to market vs feature completeness

-Security vs ease of use

-Extensibility vs supportablity


Branches:

Make a branch
Edit your code on the branch, git add, commit and push on the branch

Subject: Diagrams

We talked about making plans and organizing how our code works. It's interesting seeing how much planning goes into programming. I never hear about this sort of thing from any forms of media, its interesting seeing a new form of communication for technology.

I can tell just how important stuff like this could be if i were to do any IT for the military, I could even introduce this to my branch if its necessary.

Subject: Presenting products.

Pitch deck, baiscally explaining the essentials so that you can get someone to fund you. 

Audience, goals, design principles.

When designing diagrams, having a legend helps alot with layout and audience understanding. Having colors and shapes explained off to the side give great flow.

Subject: Website work day

We worked on our website today, we were talking about dependencies and features we wanted to add. I managed to find a neat way of using flask for my Graffitti idea, its going to need HTML to basically put a secondary lair on a users profile thats only purpose is to be drawn on.

Its super cool learning the different libraries.

Subject: Absent

I had a really bad morning, really wasnt mentally healthy, I told my teamates I wasnt doing to well but I would still work on my code for the project.

What i learned from my solo research on the graffiti add on is we use Flask as the server and import a bunch of renders. Then use HTML for the templates and user profiles. And of course to actually draw you need the css with the HTML. Its really COOL!!
