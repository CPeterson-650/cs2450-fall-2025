Subject: Flask and the job process

I learned alot about the job process, from the CEO to stakholders all the way down the chain of command leading to me, then of course to the people below me on the totem poll. 

Its really interesting to learn just how many roles there are that have nothing to do with programming that are integral in the process.

Another thing I learned was how to properly intall and utilize flask. Pretty neat
